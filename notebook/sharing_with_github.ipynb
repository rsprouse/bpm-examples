A nice way to share either one publicly is to keep a repository on github (or similar service that supports git). [Github](https://github.com) renders static displays of certain types of text file, including jupyter notebooks, which makes it easy to produce illustrations of your work.\n",

The `.gitignore` file contains filenaming patterns that exclude files that are not likely to be desirable additions to your repository.
